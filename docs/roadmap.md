# Roadmap

This roadmap organizes the remaining v1 work and beyond.

## Milestones

v0.5 Beta (stabilize foundations)
- Bible: precise last‑verse restore; book/chapter picker
- Highlights: color edit/remove from list; polish selection UI
- Notes: swap to local persistence (JSON or SharedPreferences)
- AI: scripture reference linking and Bible deep‑links
- Tests: expand widget/unit coverage per docs/testing.md

v1.0
- Home: recent notes, continue reading, quick actions
- Settings: export/clear data; text size for Bible
- AI: conversation list management; optional streaming
- Polish: accessibility passes, performance tuning, empty states

Post‑v1 (stretch)

- Rich editor: headings, lists, and verse embeds
- Audio Bible integration

## Backlog (Prioritized)

3. Highlights edit/remove in list and in‑place in Bible
4. Notes persistence layer and simple editor
5. Home surface and shortcuts
6. Settings: export/clear data, text size
7. AI conversation switcher and streaming
